# Data and code for *Animal movement responses to environmental heterogeneity and global biodiversity patterns*

**Abstract**: Species distributions should emerge from interactions between organisms and their environments, as environmental heterogeneity reduces movement, and movement influences resource partitioning among species and individual interactions that underpin community composition. Synthesizing multiple global datasets, we examined relationships between environmental heterogeneity, individual movement speeds, and home range sizes in mammals. We found that overall, individuals moved slower and had smaller home ranges in more heterogeneous environments, a pattern consistent across species regardless of body size or movement mode. Approximately one-third of the global spatial variation in mammal home range sizes was shared with species richness, with the smallest home ranges occurring in biodiversity hotspots, including many of the worldâ€™s most mountainous and heterogeneous regions. This suggests that environmental heterogeneity underpins movement and accounts for some of the shared variation in biodiversity and individual movement patterns. Our study highlights how individual behaviours contribute to the resource partitioning that maintains global biodiversity patterns.

All code was run in R v4.3.1 and runs on macOS Monterey v12.7.3
